# 🌟 **Software Effort Estimation Model**

This mini-project predicts **software effort, project duration, and cost** using basic Machine Learning models.  
The system includes a simple **GUI built with Tkinter**, where users can upload an ARFF dataset and run prediction models.

## 📘 **What This Project Does**
This tool estimates:

- **Effort** (hours/days needed)
- **Duration** (time to complete the project)
- **Project Cost**

Predictions are based on input features such as:

- **LOC** (Lines of Code)  
- **Complexity**  
- **Domain Knowledge**  
- **Team Experience**

---

## 🤖 **Machine Learning Models Used**
The project uses two regression models:

- **Linear Regression**  
- **KNN Regression (k=5)**  

Both models are trained and evaluated, and the one with better accuracy is displayed.
